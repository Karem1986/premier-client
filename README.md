# üë®‚ÄçüíªPremier Coding - Here to make coding fun! üë©‚Äçüíª

### What is this app about?

Premier coding is an application to help people to discover what is coding whilst having fun with it. It has fun elements such as a trivia quiz to help learners to know about interesting CS hsitory topics and a coding game where participants get scored according to their answers. A progress bar also shows the progress to keep participants hooked and motivated to come back. 

Its founders are 4 developers who met at a bootcamp 2 years ago, since then, they became good friends and decided to go the entrepreneurial road to make other people's coding journey much more motivating.

### Used technologies 
üí°
- React: using local state and useEffect hooks to manage components such as the progress bar and coding game
- Redux: to store user information such as token, progress and signup.
- Material UI: as an innovative way of styling large application UIs, we decided to try Material UI to enhance our styling. 
- Sequelize ORM to communicate with Postgres SQL database
